GENERAL:
Good:
 - TDD
 - The test cases covered the important edge cases.

To improve:
 - Commits are too big.
 - We did not decouple the logic for each different type of item. What if changes are requested. What if new items are requested.
 - QA (Me :)) Found a bug if we try to initialize items over there default max QUALITY.

Missing:
 - No way to compare old and new results. Capturing the initial fixture would have been a good test.
